I play an active role in the tech industry, take part in meetups and hackathons. I enjoy giving back to the open source community by participating in discussions and sharing what I do here, on Chased by Penguins, my Github and others. I work on a few interesting side projects. Giving them various amounts of love at various times. Stay in touch by subscribing to my page if you want to know more. I've released a few apps on the Google Play Store too.

Join my quest for tech on *nix based machines, Node.js and web stuff and maybe you too will get #ChasedByPenguins !
